"""The Postgres backend: the parts testable without a server, and a live suite.

Two layers, deliberately separated.

  * Everything above `TestLivePostgres` runs everywhere, including on a machine
    with no PostgreSQL and no psycopg2. It covers the pure helpers and — more
    usefully — asserts that the two store implementations still present the *same
    surface*. That structural test is what catches the real risk of a second
    backend: a method added to one and forgotten in the other, which fails at
    runtime in the deployment that has the newer store and nowhere else.
  * `TestLivePostgres` runs only when `TOOLMARKET_TEST_PG_DSN` is set, which the
    compose verification does (`docker compose exec api python -m pytest`). It
    exercises the SQL, the JSONB round trip and cross-process visibility — none
    of which a fake cursor can honestly test.
