"""Locks the ablation's *measurement*, not just the gate.

The experiment in `experiments/ablation_hint_stress.py` concludes that a
prompt-level guard is a coin flip while the gate is deterministic. That
conclusion is only worth anything if the harness can actually *see* the thing
it claims to see: a widening candidate must show up as drift, and the gate must
veto it. During this work the measurement path was briefly suspected of being
blind to `dynamic_code_execution`; it was not (that label is already in the
`redact_secrets` seed, so it is not widening), but nothing in the suite would
have caught it if it had been.

So these tests pin the two halves of the claim down with no LLM in the loop:

  1. the same widening candidate, committed under a gate-less operator, is
     *visible* as drift -- the harness is not blind; and
  2. the same candidate, assessed by the real gate, is vetoed -- so it can
     never reach the commit path in the first place.

If (1) ever breaks, the experiment silently reports "intact" no matter what the
model writes. If (2) ever breaks, the whole design claim is gone. Either
failure should be a red test, not a nice-looking chart.
