"""PostgreSQL persistence — the same three tables, a different engine.

`store.py` says the store is deliberately dumb and that "a different backend
(Postgres, a file tree, an object store) can replace this without touching
anything above it". This module is that claim tested rather than asserted: it
implements the *same duck-typed surface* as `ResourceStore` and nothing above
the store changes. `ResourceRegistry` cannot tell the two apart, which is why
there is no interface to extract — the interface was always the method names.

Four differences from the SQLite store are deliberate:

  * `json` columns are **JSONB**, not TEXT. The substrate's records are queried,
    not just fetched (which resources are ACTIVE, which events belong to a
    resource), and JSONB makes that a database question instead of a Python one.
  * `append_event` is a plain `INSERT`, with no `ON CONFLICT` clause at all. The
    event log is append-only by contract, and *both* clauses are wrong here:
    `DO UPDATE` would be a silent tamper path, and `DO NOTHING` would silently
    drop a racing writer's event — the caller would be told it appended when it
    did not, which is the same data loss with better manners. A duplicate `seq`
    therefore raises `UniqueViolation`: the database refusing to fork the chain
    or to lose an event from it. The SQLite store keeps the identical contract
    with a bare `INSERT`.
  * `stats()["path"]` returns a **redacted DSN**. The SQLite store returns a file
    path because a file path cannot hold a password. A DSN can, and this dict is
    reachable from `GET /stats` — so the password is stripped here rather than
    left to every caller to remember.
  * The next `seq` and the chain head live in a one-row `event_head` table, which
    an append locks with `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`. SQLite gets the same guarantee
    from `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, which locks the whole database; Postgres has no
    coarse switch like that, so the lock has to be named. Without a lock the
    allocation is a read of a value another writer is about to move, and the
    `events` primary key catches the collision only after the client has been
    told its registration failed.

Connections come from a `ThreadedConnectionPool`: the API serves requests on a
threadpool and the Celery worker runs in another process entirely, so a single
shared connection with a lock would serialize both against each other.
