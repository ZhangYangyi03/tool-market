"""ResourceRegistry — the substrate's front door.

Everything a caller can do to a resource goes through here, and every mutation
leaves both an event and (where relevant) a lineage node. The registry owns the
three pieces of protocol state — records, the event log, the lineage DAG — and
keeps them consistent with each other and with the backing `autoforge` registry.

Enforcement is not optional here. `register` admits a resource at DRAFT; it
becomes callable-as-trusted only by walking the lifecycle. `replace_live` (the
commit step of evolution) re-opens the trial: a new version of an ACTIVE tool
drops back to PROBATION until it has re-earned trust. That single line is the
difference between a registry and a marketplace with a badge.
