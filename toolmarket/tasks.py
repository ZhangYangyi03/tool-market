"""Asynchronous evolution: the queue, and what happens when there isn't one.

An evolution is propose (call a model) → assess (run the verifier: execution,
robustness, adversarial, trigger) → commit. The assessment step is *slow and
unbounded* — it runs candidate code in a harness — so serving it on the request
thread means a single evolution can hold a worker for minutes and the API's
latency becomes a function of the slowest candidate anyone submitted. That is
the reason this module exists; it is not architecture for its own sake.

The design decision worth reading: **`InlineQueue` is the default, not a
fallback.** If `TASK_QUEUE` is unset the API still answers `POST .../evolve`
with a task id and `GET /tasks/{id}` still works — the work just happens on a
background thread of the API process and the same task record is written. So
every client, every test and every doc example uses one protocol, and switching
to Celery changes throughput rather than the contract. A design where the async
path only exists when Redis is present produces two code paths, and the one
nobody runs in development is the one that breaks in production.

Task records live in the cache (Redis when there is one) with a TTL, not in the
database. A task record is operational exhaust: it is worthless after an hour and
writing every progress tick to durable storage would put the queue's write volume
through the same connection pool as the audit log.
