# The stack as a dependency graph rather than a script.
#
# Why this exists next to docker-compose.yml, stated honestly: for a purely local
# run, compose is the better tool and this file does not change that. What it adds
# is that the topology is a *graph with a plan* — `terraform plan` says what will
# change before anything does, and the same variables can be re-pointed at a
# remote provider without rewriting the topology. Compose has neither property.
# The two descriptors are kept equivalent on purpose; where they differ, it is
# noted at the point of difference.
#
# The dependency edges are mostly implicit (a container references the network
# and the image it needs) and one is deliberately absent: nothing here waits for
# Postgres to be *healthy* before starting the API, because the app already
# tolerates that race — `make_store` calls `store.wait_ready(attempts=30,
# delay=1.0)` for the Postgres backend. Modelling it here as well would be the
# second copy of one guarantee, and the copy is the one that goes stale.
