# Terraform: the stack as a graph with a plan

`docker-compose.yml` and this directory describe the same five services. This is
not a replacement for compose and does not pretend to be — for a purely local
run, compose is the better tool: shorter, no state file, no provider download.
What Terraform adds is two properties compose does not have.

**A plan.** `terraform plan` prints every change before any of it happens. That
matters when the thing you are about to change is a database volume whose name
determines whether the data survives.

**A separable topology.** The service graph here is expressed against variables,
not against Docker. Re-pointing it at a remote provider — the same five roles as
an ECS cluster, a Render stack, a Kubernetes namespace — is a change of provider
block and resource types, not a re-derivation of what talks to what. That is the
part that transfers off a laptop, and it is why this exists at all.

## Run it

```sh
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform plan          # read this
terraform apply         # builds the image, starts five containers
```

Then verify it actually found the backends rather than falling back:

```sh
terraform output -raw ready_url | xargs curl -s
```

`/ready` reports the backend it connected to. The whole point of this stack over
the free-tier cloud one is that the answer must be `postgres` and `redis`, not
`sqlite` and `memory`.

Tear down:

```sh
terraform destroy       # keeps the Postgres image and the volume; see below
```

## What it creates

| Resource | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `docker_network.substrate` | User-defined network, so containers resolve each other by alias |
| `docker_volume.pgdata` | Postgres data |
| `docker_image.app` | Built from `../Dockerfile`, target `runtime` |
| `docker_container.postgres` | `postgres:16-alpine`, healthchecked on the app's own DB |
| `docker_container.redis` | `redis:7-alpine`, no persistence, LRU at 128 MB |
| `docker_container.api` | Uvicorn, published on `api_port` |
| `docker_container.worker` | Celery, `count = 0` when `task_queue = "inline"` |

## Decisions worth knowing

**The API does not wait for Postgres to be healthy, and that is deliberate.**
The app already tolerates the race — `make_store` calls
`store.wait_ready(attempts=30, delay=1.0)` for the Postgres backend. Adding a
Terraform-level wait would be a second copy of one guarantee, and the copy is the
one that goes stale.

**Container names are prefixed with `stack_name`; DNS aliases are not.** The DSNs
say `postgres:5432` and `redis:6379` because those are the aliases. Change
`stack_name` to run a second copy of the stack alongside the first and every
connection string stays valid.

**The app image rebuilds on `Dockerfile` and `pyproject.toml` hashes.** The
second one is not optional: `pyproject.toml` pins autoforge to a commit, and a
pin that moves changes the enforcement engine's behaviour without changing a line
of this repository. Without the trigger, Terraform would see an unchanged image
name, keep the stale one, and the symptom would be a fix that passes locally and
is silently ignored in the container.

**State is gitignored and must stay that way.** `terraform.tfstate` holds the
Postgres password in cleartext, because that is what the resource declares. It is
also why `postgres_password` is marked `sensitive` — that keeps it out of plan
output and CI logs, which is a different leak from the state file and the more
common one.

**`keep_locally = true` on the base images.** `destroy` removes containers and
volumes but not the 80 MB of Postgres and Redis you will re-pull on the next
apply. The images are not what this config owns.

## Not here

No remote backend, no locking, no workspaces, no `terraform fmt` in CI. A local
single-operator stack needs none of them, and adding a backend that nothing reads
is the kind of configuration that looks mature and is never exercised.
